# News
Simple client-server android news app. This app was created just for demonstrate.

Project based on **MVP architecture**  
and use most often used and approved by the community libraries and instrumens , such as:  
**Dagger 2,  
RxJava,  
Retrofit,  
GSON,  
ButterKnife,  
Firebase Analytics,  
Firebase Crashlitiscs,  
Fabric Crashlitiscs**  
and other.  

And at an early date I'm going add some libraries and instrumens:  
**Glide,  
Room,   
Perfomance**.
